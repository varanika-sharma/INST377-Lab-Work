<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

<p>How to say "Hello!"" in different languages</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hello</li>
   <li>Bonjour</li> 
    <li>Hola</li>
</ul>
   
    
    <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>21: Adele</li>
    <li>Folklore: Taylor Swift </li>
    <li>Queen II: Queen</li>
    <li>4: Foreigner</li>
    <li>Abbey Road: The Beatles</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text. </p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text. </p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</p> 

<p>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>

<p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
